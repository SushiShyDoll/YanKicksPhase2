# YanKicks
## Project Overview
YanKicks is a fully functional, full-stack e-commerce platform designed for selling premium athletic footwear. Built with native PHP and MySQL, it features a responsive user interface, a dynamic shopping cart, and a comprehensive admin panel for inventory management.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of YanKicks is to demonstrate the development of a complete, production-ready e-commerce solution from scratch without relying on pre-built CMS platforms like WordPress or Shopify.

Key Objectives:

To solve a business problem: Provide a streamlined, user-friendly platform for sneaker enthusiasts in the Philippines to discover and purchase premium footwear with local payment options like GCash.

To demonstrate technical proficiency: Showcase full-stack capabilities by integrating a custom frontend with a raw PHP/MySQL backend, handling real-world data relationships (Users, Products, Orders).

To bridge the gap: Create a seamless connection between inventory management (Admin) and the shopping experience (Customer), ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.
